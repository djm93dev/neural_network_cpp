# Neural Network Implementation with Backpropagation

This code provides a `C++` implementation of a simple `neural network` using `backpropagation`. The neural network is capable of learning and making predictions based on a given set of inputs and targets. Here is a brief description of the code:

1. The code begins by defining the `NeuralNetwork` class, which encapsulates the functionality of the neural network. It includes private member variables to store the number of inputs, hidden neurons, output neurons, weights, biases, and output values of the hidden and output layers.

2. The constructor of the `NeuralNetwork` class initializes the network by generating random weights and biases for each neuron in the hidden and output layers.

3. The `sigmoid` function computes the sigmoid activation function for a given input value.

4. The `sigmoid_derivative` function calculates the derivative of the sigmoid activation function.

5. The `feed_forward` function takes a set of input values and performs the forward propagation step, computing the outputs of the hidden and output layers based on the current weights and biases.

6. The `backpropagation` function implements the backpropagation algorithm to update the weights and biases of the neural network based on the errors between the predicted outputs and the target outputs.

7. The `train` function trains the neural network using a given set of training inputs and targets. It iterates over the training data for a specified number of epochs, performing forward propagation and backpropagation for each training example.

8. The `save_weights` function saves the current weights and biases of the neural network to a file specified by the provided filename.

9. The `load_weights` function loads the weights and biases from a file, verifying compatibility with the dimensions of the current network.

10. In the `main` function, a sample usage scenario is provided. The code checks if a weights file exists. If it does, the weights are loaded. Otherwise, the neural network is trained on a specific dataset (OR, AND, XOR, or NOR) and the weights are saved to a file.

11. Finally, the code tests the trained neural network by providing test inputs and printing the corresponding output predictions.

This implementation serves as a basic framework for training and utilizing neural networks for various tasks. The network architecture and training data can be modified to suit different problem domains.
